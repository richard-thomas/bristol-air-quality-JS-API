# Bristol Air Quality Interactive Web Map (JavaScript API)
This is a demonstrator JavaScript Web App built using ESRI ArcGIS JavaScript API. It pulls together several Bristol City Council openly-published datasets and ESRI basemaps, dynamically extracting much of the structure from an ArcGIS-online web map. A primary aim was to ensure that this worked equally well on a mobile phone or tablet as on a desktop computer. 

The source code is within the "public_html" sub-directory and the web app is directly hosted here on GitHub and can be run here:

The small number of files in this build can be compared with the large number (>6000, though most are unused) generated by the "ESRI ArcGIS Web App Builder", the output of which can be viewed here:
